<p><b>TetrisLayout</b> is a powerful Java layout.</p>

<p>With TetrisLayout you can</p>

<ul>
    <li>create variable grid layouts with variable gaps between components;</li>

    <li>span components between multiple rows and colums;</li>

    <li>assign different weights to rows and columns;</li>

    <li>set absolute startup sizes to rows and columns;</li>

    <li>set custom startup sizes to rows and columns using Connectors;</li>

    <li>fill and anchor a component in a grid cell in many different ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition you can debug your layout and all nested ones directly drawing them
<br>
on your component panel.
